# RimWorld Base Generator

A web application for generating optimal base layouts for RimWorld colonies.

Design your buildings, set their relationships, and let the physics simulation automatically arrange them into an efficient layout. The app uses force-based algorithms to position buildings based on their connections and importance, creating functional colony designs.
